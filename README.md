nandland book tasks, implemented with the icestorm toolchain rather than IceCube2 (which sucks).

Could be useful for anyone working through the book who needs some help bringing the gaps (for example icestorm doesn't support sdc files which are referenced in the book, instead using a python file to define clocks).

tests start in 4_switch_debounce and are handled using cocotb.
